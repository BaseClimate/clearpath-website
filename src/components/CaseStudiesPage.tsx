      clientName: "Sarah J.",
      location: "Richmond Hill, ON",
      profession: "Teacher and mother of two",
      initialDebt: 22000,
      totalSavings: 11000,
      timeToStopPayments: "12 Days",
      problem: "Sarah J., a teacher and mother of two from Richmond Hill, was sold a new tankless water heater by a door-to-door salesperson who promised significant energy savings. The monthly payment seemed manageable, so she signed. It wasn't until she tried to make changes to her budget a year later that she discovered the truth: she was locked into a 15-year contract with a total buyout cost of over $22,000. She felt sick and powerless.",
      process: "Sarah contacted ClearPath feeling defeated. Our team immediately initiated our 3-step process. In her free case review, we identified multiple violations of the Consumer Protection Act in how the contract was sold and worded. We connected Sarah with a specialized legal partner who, within 12 days, filed an official Notice of Cancellation with the finance company. At that point, Sarah stopped her old payments and started her new, lower ClearPath payment plan.",
      result: "While our legal partner managed the entire resolution process, Sarah was already saving money. Within 8 months, the original contract was officially terminated. The lien on her home was removed, and her total debt was reduced by over $11,000. Today, she has peace of mind, a lower monthly payment that includes all maintenance, and is completely free from the predatory contract.",

      initialDebt: 45000,
      totalSavings: 22500,
      timeToStopPayments: "10 Days",
      problem: "Mark T. from Hamilton was horrified to learn that his elderly father, who lived alone, had been pressured into signing contracts for a new furnace and tankless water heater. The combined buyout cost was a staggering $45,000, and a lien had been placed on the family home. His father was confused and scared, and Mark knew he had to act.",
      process: "Mark uploaded his father's contracts to the ClearPath portal. Our review confirmed what Mark suspected: the sales tactics were aggressive, the promises of government rebates were misleading, and the contracts violated multiple consumer protection laws. A legal partner was assigned immediately. In just 10 days, the Notice of Cancellation was sent, and the predatory payments were stopped.",
      result: "The finance company initially pushed back, but our legal partner's arguments, based on ClearPath's proven case framework, were undeniable. The contracts were fully terminated and the lien was dissolved. Mark's father was saved from a crippling debt of over $22,500. He kept the equipment and, most importantly, his dignity and security.",
      quote: "I can't thank ClearPath enough for what they did for my father. They saved him over $22,500 and gave our family our peace of mind back. They are true advocates for the vulnerable.",

      profession: "Business owner",
      initialDebt: 9000,
      totalSavings: 4500,
      timeToStopPayments: "8 Days",
      problem: "David L., a successful business owner from Mississauga, was approached by a salesperson claiming to represent a government energy efficiency program. They convinced him to sign up for a 'high-tech HEPA air filtration system' that would supposedly save him hundreds on his energy bills. When David realized he'd been tricked into a $9,000 contract for a simple air filter, his business instincts kicked in—this was fraud, plain and simple.",
      process: "David's case moved quickly through our system. As a business owner, he had kept detailed records of the sales interaction, which made identifying the violations straightforward. Our legal partner found multiple breaches: misrepresentation of government affiliation, false energy savings claims, and failure to provide proper cooling-off period documentation. The Notice of Cancellation was filed within 8 days.",
      result: "The finance company attempted to dispute the cancellation, but the evidence was overwhelming. David's contract was terminated, saving him over $4,500. More importantly for David, the principle of the matter was addressed—he had successfully fought back against predatory tactics and won.",
      quote: "As a business owner, I was furious when I realized I'd been tricked. The frustration was immense. ClearPath's model is brilliant—they saved me over $4,500, handled the entire legal process, and made fighting back on principle not only possible, but simple.",
